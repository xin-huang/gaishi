    Spectrum statistic.

    Computes per-individual allele-frequency spectra (ArchIE-style i-ton)
    from a target population genotype matrix.

    Notes
    -----
    This implementation is stateless. Use `compute` as a static
    function; no instance initialization is required.
    """

    @staticmethod
    def compute(**kwargs) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Computes per-individual frequency spectra for the target population.

        Parameters
        ----------
        **kwargs
            tgt_gts : np.ndarray
                Genotype matrix of shape `(n_sites, n_samples)` for the target population.
            is_phased : bool
                If `True`, treat genotypes as phased haplotypes (effective ploidy = 1).
            ploidy : int
                Sample ploidy when `is_phased` is `False` (ignored otherwise).

        Returns
        -------
        dict
            A dictionary with a single key:
            `{"spectrum": np.ndarray}`, where the array has shape
            `(n_samples, n_bins)` and `n_bins = n_samples * ploidy + 1`.
            Bin 0 is zeroed to exclude non-segregating sites (ArchIE behavior).

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If any required key is missing.
