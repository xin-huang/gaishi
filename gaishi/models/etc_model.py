        Train an extra-trees classifier on tabular feature data.

        The input feature table is read from a tab-separated file, a model is
        fitted, and the trained model is written to disk. Any keyword arguments
        in `model_params` are forwarded to the underlying
        :class:`sklearn.ensemble.ExtraTreesClassifier`. If data scaling is
        enabled (e.g. via an `is_scaled` flag in `model_params`), the feature
        matrix is scaled using :class:`sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler`
        and the fitted scaler is saved alongside the model file.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data : str
            Path to the training data file in tab-separated format. The table
            is expected to contain a `Label` column and any required metadata
            columns, which will be dropped before model fitting.
        output : str

        **model_params
            Additional keyword arguments controlling the model and optional
            preprocessing. These are passed to the underlying extra-trees
            classifier (for example `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `random_state`)
            and may also include flags such as `is_scaled` to indicate that
            the feature data should be standardized before training.

        """
        Perform inference with a trained extra-trees classifier on new data.

        The feature table is read from a tab-separated file, the trained model is
        loaded from disk, and predictions are written to the specified output.
        Any keyword arguments in `model_params` are forwarded to the underlying
        :class:`sklearn.ensemble.ExtraTreesClassifier` or used to control
        optional preprocessing. If an `is_scaled` flag is provided and set to
        True, a scaler object is loaded from `<model>.scaler` and applied to
        the feature matrix before inference.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data : str
            Path to the inference data file in tab-separated format. The table
            is expected to contain the same feature columns as the training
            data, along with any metadata columns that will be dropped before
            prediction.
        model : str
            Path to the saved trained model (e.g. a joblib pickle). If
            `is_scaled=True` is passed via `model_params`, the method will
            also look for a corresponding scaler file at `<model>.scaler` and
            apply it to the features.
        output : str
            Path where the inference output (e.g. predicted labels or
            probabilities) will be written.
        **model_params
            Additional keyword arguments controlling the model and optional
            preprocessing. These are typically forwarded to the underlying
            extra-trees classifier (for example `n_jobs`, `random_state`) and
            may include an `is_scaled` flag indicating that a saved scaler
            should be loaded and applied prior to prediction.
