        Train a logistic regression model using provided training data.

        The input feature table is read from a tab-separated file, a model is
        fitted, and the trained model is written to disk. Any keyword arguments
        in `model_params` are forwarded to the underlying
        :class:`sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression`. If data scaling is
        enabled (e.g. via an `is_scaled` flag in `model_params`), the feature
        matrix is scaled using :class:`sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler`
        and the fitted scaler is saved alongside the model file.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data : str

        Perform inference using a trained logistic regression model on new data.

        The feature table is read from a tab-separated file, the trained model is
        loaded from disk, and predictions are written to the specified output.
        Any keyword arguments in `model_params` are forwarded to the underlying
        :class:`sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` or used to control
        optional preprocessing. If an `is_scaled` flag is provided and set to
        True, a scaler object is loaded from `<model>.scaler` and applied to
        the feature matrix before inference.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data : str
            Path to the inference data file in tab-separated format.
        model : str
            Path to the saved trained model. The method will also look for `<model_file>.scaler`
            if `is_scaled` is True to load and apply the scaler.
        output : str
